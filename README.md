## Overview

This is a simple program that was coded in C++ that allows the user to upload their README.md file (or any markdowned file) 
and generate a Table of Contents with it.

## Usage

This program can work with other types of GitHub marked files. Using this program is simple: All you need to do is
type in your project name into the first textbox and your username into the second textbook. Then select your .md file.

The reasoning for putting in your project name and username is for the purpose of formatting your hyperlinks. The bottom
far left button will allow you to change between numbers and bullets (see images above). 

## Examples

I used my [Dreamstride YGOPro Archetype](https://github.com/AHXR/Dreamstride-YGOPro-) and [React VR by andrewimm](https://github.com/facebook/react-vr) to test this 
program out. If you take a look at both of the respiratories, you can see that one is simple and the other one is complex.
Everything seems to format fine despite that design and complexity within someone's markdown.
